Export the current Claude Code chat session using the following workflow:

1. Use Claude Code MCP to export the current chat session to a temporary file
2. Copy the exported file to the repository with a timestamp:
   `chat-session-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).md`
3. Create a git commit that includes:
   - The chat session file
   - Complete chat content in the commit message
   - Clear restoration instructions in the commit message header
   - A prompt that can be used to restore the session context

The commit message should include:

- üîÑ RESTORATION INSTRUCTIONS section with step-by-step commands
- üìù CHAT SESSION CONTENT section with the full chat history
- Environment information and project context

This allows saving chat sessions as git commits that can be restored later by
checking out the commit and using the chat content to restore context in a new
Claude Code session.
